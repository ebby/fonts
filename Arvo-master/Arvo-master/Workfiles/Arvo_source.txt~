The initial drawing was made as Multiple master with Postscript contours, in Fontlab.

You can find Multiple master source in /Fontlab folder.
Drawing had been scaled  to Truetype UPM box. 2048 units.

Unfortunately gradually final files have distanced themselves from those files.
I have used TTX tools to manipulate intermediate Truetype (.ttf files)
And moreover corrected Truetype curves in VTT to be able to work on hints.

Release versions in late november 2010 were
Roman and italic v.104
Bold cuts (roman and italic): v.105 (corrected mac indesign activation problem, naming tables)
